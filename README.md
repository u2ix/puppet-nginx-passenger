## Puppet Nginx Module

This is a fork of [puppet-nginx](https://bitbucket.org/sgmac/puppet-nginx) to install nginx with
passenger using default ruby version on debian wheezy or ubuntu quantal and **without rvm**.


### Basic usage

Install nginx with

```
include nginx
```

A custom installation might look like this:

``` 
node webserver { 
    class { 'nginx':
	 $installdir => '/usr/local/nginx',
	 $logdir     => '/usr/local/logs/nginx',
    }
}
```

### Virtual Hosts

You can easily configure a virtual hosts. An example is:

```
nginx::vhost { 'www.example.com':
	port => '8080'
	rails => true,
}
```
The _rails_ attribute is optional and set to false by default. However, if you want to deploy a rails app, use this attribute and the rails template will be used instead.
